# General Practice

* Katas come from [codewars](http://www.codewars.com/)
* Project Euler questions come from [euler](https://projecteuler.net)
* Sample Interview Questions from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20ahfq/heres_a_pretty_big_list_of_programming_interview/)

* Some are hard, some are easy.  Either way its just practice!
